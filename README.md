 ### What's in here?

 This simple repo showcases how Cypress can be used to create a positive and negative test while running and E2E test. This demo shows how cypress uses custom commands such that it can be reused.

 ### Setup Guide

- [ ] Clone the repository: `git clone` command
- [ ] Navigate into the cloned repository
- [ ] Run `npm ci` to execute a clean install via the `package-lock.json` from the terminal in the repository. This ensures all dependencies are installed with the specified versions. Or run `npm i` or `npm install` to execute an installation using the `package.json`

### Execution Rule

- [ ] From inside the repository's terminal, run `npx cypress run` to run it headlessly
- [ ] Use `npx cypress open --e2e` to open the test runner and run it with a browser
